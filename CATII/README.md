This is a simplified University Management System that manages faculty, students, courses, and departments within a university setting. This system will allow for the addition, modification, and querying of information related to these entities. This project will demonstrate the application of key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles including inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and exception handling.
